### Non Technical Assignment ###
**Question 2**<br><br>
I am Divyanshu Gupta, a first-year UG in the Chemical department. I am currently working as a Software Developer in the AUV-IITB tech team. My passion lies in programming, particularly in the realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).<br> 
I love to do CV tasks in AUV and I love to integrate the knowledge of core CS (knowledge of data structures and algorithms) into Machine Learning and Deep Learning Tasks. I love to Design new algorithms. <br>
While doing this assignment I learned a lot about Deep Learning and I loved working on it. Designing new models, adding new layers, finding an optimum way to set these layers so that code works efficiently, and finding its solution on the internet have fascinated me a lot. I also learned many things about CNN and has evoked my interest my interest for AI and ML much more than before. I also liked working on that chatbot assignment using RAG and it was a very new thing for me but while working on it I found it very much interesting. Each challenge has sparked my curiosity and further fueled my passion for AI and ML.<br>
My ultimate goal is to learn and research in the field of AI and ML and joining this AI community will help me a lot to fulfill my dream. I further want to do __Masters__ in the same so this community will help me pursue my dream. I would love to be a part of the AI community and pursue my passion.
