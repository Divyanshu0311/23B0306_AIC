### how to use ###
Use these on __Google Colab__ in __T4 GPU__ runtime<br>
Make sure to install all used libraries using  !pip install <library_name> <br> 
* For T_Q1_CIFAR10.ipynb (major code I submitted) and T_Q1_CIFAR100.ipynb use google colab and change runtime type to T4 GPU for faster processing.
* For T_Q3.ipynb I have written what to do in every cell and it just needs to be executed in __Google Colab__.
